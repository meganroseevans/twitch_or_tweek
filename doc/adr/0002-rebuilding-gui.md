# 2. rebuilding-gui

Date: 2024-01-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I originally built the game using Streamlit for a couple of reasons:
1. I've worked with Streamlit before and found it easy and intuitive
1. The pre-packaged components make building the interface fast so I can focus on game mechanics rather than the UI

I want to migrate off Streamlit because it's high-level nature makes it easy to use also means that it is restrictive.

## Decision

The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement.

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
